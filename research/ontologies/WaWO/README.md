# WaWO / WaWO+ (WasteWater Ontology) - Research Report

**Status**: ❌ **UNAVAILABLE**

**Date Investigated**: 2025-12-17

## Summary

WaWO (WasteWater Ontology) and its extension WaWO+ are frequently cited in water/wastewater ontology literature but the OWL files are **not publicly available** despite extensive searching.

## Search Attempts

- Official repositories (GitHub, GitLab, institutional pages): Not found
- W3C/OGC specifications: Not applicable
- Original publications: References found but no links to ontology files
- Namespace resolution: Unable to verify
- Direct ontology file access: Not available

## Citations in Literature

WaWO/WaWO+ are mentioned in:
- Various water ontology survey papers
- Wastewater treatment ontology comparisons
- Related ontology engineering work in the water domain

However, none of these citations provide:
- Downloadable OWL/RDF files
- Accessible namespace URIs
- Working repository links
- Protégé project files

## Impact on Project

**Coverage Assessment**: CANNOT BE EVALUATED

This ontology cannot be evaluated against our competency questions or considered for:
- Direct reuse
- Extension
- Bridging to our waterFRAME ontology
- Pattern extraction

## Recommendation

**EXCLUDE** from further consideration until/unless the ontology files become publicly available.

## Notes

This is a common problem in ontology engineering where:
1. Papers describe ontologies in detail
2. Ontologies may have been developed for specific projects
3. Files were never made publicly available or
4. Files were hosted on institutional servers that are no longer maintained

When evaluating ontology landscape papers, treat citations to WaWO/WaWO+ with caution as they reference unavailable resources.

**Researcher Notes**: After extensive search across multiple channels, confirmed unavailable as of December 2025.
